#This folder contains the tsv files with for each of the enrichments results (to be included as an insert in the bottom).
#These files have for rows pairwise comparison between each cell type of interest and each cluster of the target dataset ("reference_dataset.enrichment_dataset" named "", for example "hg12_PCC_KEql17.5SympthAdrnlDvlpmntCllsTyps.tsv"). The columns are in order:
0) cell type
1) cluster
2) genes cluster of interest in cell type of interest
3) genes cluster of interest NOT in cell type of interest
4) genes NOT in cluster of interest in cell type of interest
5) genes NOT in cluster of interest NOT in cell type of interest
6) stat
7) p-value
8) Genes_enriched_in_cluster
9) FDR
10) significance
